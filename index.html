          My name is Bowen Qi, and I started my journey at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) in the fall of 2022.
          I major in Computer Science and have been a student here for a year and a half.
          Before moving to UCR, I lived in Zhejiang, China, and completed my high school education at Zhenhai High School in Ningbo, Zhejiang.
          Currently, I am not a member of any formal student organizations and do not hold any officer positions in campus groups.
          However, I actively participate in activities that aren't directly related to my coursework.
          As of now, I am not employed, but I am diligently seeking job opportunities this year to gain professional experience while continuing my studies at UCR.
          <br><br>
          In my leisure and recreation time, I have a variety of interests that keep me engaged and entertained.
          I make it a point to watch movies at least once a week, which helps me relax and stay updated with the latest in cinema.
          Gaming is another passion of mine, with HearthStone and Civilization VI being my go-to games.
          These games not only provide entertainment but also challenge my strategic thinking skills.
          I frequently visit the gym, which is an integral part of my routine.
          Staying physically fit and active is important to me, and the gym is the perfect place for this.
          In addition to physical exercise, I am also a member of the chess club where I play chess regularly.
          This not only serves as a mental workout but also allows me to interact with fellow chess enthusiasts.
          Although I am not an athlete on a team, I have a musical background.
          I practiced the clarinet during my childhood, but I have not kept up with it and have forgotten most of it now.
          Traveling is also one of my interests, and I have had the opportunity to explore various places of interest in China.
          Some of these include the Great Wall, the Forbidden City in Beijing, the Terracotta Army in Xi'an, the picturesque landscapes of Guilin, and the bustling city of Shanghai.
          Each of these places has offered me unique experiences and a deeper understanding of my cultural heritage.
          <br><br>
          As a student at the University of California, Riverside (UCR), I chose Computer Science as my major, reflecting my deep interest in the ever-evolving field of technology.
          My academic journey at UCR began with an array of stimulating courses, but the one that stood out the most was CS 205, focused on Artificial Intelligence.
          This course was particularly interesting as it involved a challenging yet captivating project where I had to develop a program to play PAC-MAN games.
          The process of coding this program was both demanding and exhilarating, and it culminated in a rewarding outcome as I succeeded in writing the code and earned an 'A' for my efforts.
          My first quarter at UCR was a time of exploration and learning, but by my third quarter, I had delved deeper into the complexities of my field.
          I enrolled in CS 219, an advanced algorithms class, which proved to be much harder than my previous courses.
          This course pushed me to expand my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of algorithmic concepts, which was a significant step up from the challenges I faced in my first quarter.
          Throughout my entire experience as a student at UCR, I have learned to adopt new strategies for success.
          I've realized the importance of collaborative learning and have often sought the perspectives of my peers and instructors to broaden my understanding.
          This approach has been particularly beneficial in tackling complex topics and projects.
          Additionally, I have learned the value of consistent study habits and time management, which have been crucial in balancing the rigorous demands of my coursework.
